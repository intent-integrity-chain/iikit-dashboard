# IIKit Kanban Board Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

TDD MUST be used for all feature development. Tests MUST be written before
implementation code. The red-green-refactor cycle MUST be strictly followed:
write a failing test, write the minimum code to make it pass, then refactor.

Test specifications generated by `/iikit-05-testify` MUST NOT be modified
to match implementation behavior. If tests fail, the implementation is wrong,
not the tests.

**Rationale**: Test-first development prevents the circular verification
problem where AI agents weaken assertions to match buggy code. Tests define
the contract; implementation fulfills it.

### II. Real-Time Accuracy

The system MUST reflect the true state of the project at all times. Displayed
information MUST be derived directly from project artifacts on disk, not from
cached or stale data. When artifacts change, the display MUST update promptly.

**Rationale**: A dashboard that shows stale information is worse than no
dashboard at all. Users must trust that what they see is current.

### IV. Professional Kanban UI

The dashboard MUST look and feel like a professional kanban tool. The visual
design MUST be on par with industry-leading kanban boards (Trello, Linear,
Jira, Notion). Cards MUST have clean typography, smooth transitions, and
clear visual hierarchy. The board MUST feel like a polished product, not a
developer prototype.

**Rationale**: Developers already use best-in-class tools daily. A dashboard
that looks like a homework project will not be adopted. Professional UI builds
trust in the data it displays and makes the tool a pleasure to keep open.

### V. Simplicity

Start simple. Prefer the minimal solution that solves the user's problem.
Do not add features, abstractions, or configurability beyond what is
specified. Follow YAGNI principles strictly.

**Rationale**: Complexity is the enemy of reliability and maintainability.
A simple tool that works reliably is more valuable than a complex tool
with more features.

## Quality Standards

- All code MUST have corresponding tests written before implementation
- All user-facing features MUST have acceptance criteria in the specification
- Error messages MUST be clear and actionable
- The system MUST be usable without reading documentation
- Accessibility MUST be considered for all visual elements

## Development Workflow

- Features MUST follow the IIKit workflow: specify, clarify, plan, checklist,
  testify, tasks, analyze, implement
- Each phase MUST be completed before proceeding to the next
- Assertion integrity MUST be maintained throughout the development process
- Code reviews MUST verify compliance with this constitution

## Governance

This constitution governs all development on the IIKit Kanban Board project.
All contributions MUST comply with these principles. Amendments require:

1. A written proposal documenting the change and rationale
2. Review of downstream impact on existing specifications and plans
3. Version bump following semantic versioning (MAJOR for principle changes,
   MINOR for additions, PATCH for clarifications)

**Version**: 1.1.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-10 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-10
