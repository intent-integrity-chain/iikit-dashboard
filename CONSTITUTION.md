# IIKit Kanban Board Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Test-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

TDD MUST be used for all feature development. Tests MUST be written before
implementation code. The red-green-refactor cycle MUST be strictly followed:
write a failing test, write the minimum code to make it pass, then refactor.

Test specifications generated by `/iikit-05-testify` MUST NOT be modified
to match implementation behavior. If tests fail, the implementation is wrong,
not the tests.

**Rationale**: Test-first development prevents the circular verification
problem where AI agents weaken assertions to match buggy code. Tests define
the contract; implementation fulfills it.

### II. Specification-Driven Development

Every feature MUST begin with a specification that defines WHAT users need
before any decisions about HOW to build it. Specifications MUST be
technology-agnostic and focused on user value.

Implementation MUST NOT begin until the specification is complete and the
plan has been created. The specification is the source of truth for what
the system does.

**Rationale**: Starting with specifications ensures the team builds the
right thing, not just something that works. It creates a traceable chain
from intent to implementation.

### III. Real-Time Accuracy

The system MUST reflect the true state of the project at all times. Displayed
information MUST be derived directly from project artifacts on disk, not from
cached or stale data. When artifacts change, the display MUST update promptly.

**Rationale**: A dashboard that shows stale information is worse than no
dashboard at all. Users must trust that what they see is current.

### IV. Graceful Degradation

The system MUST handle incomplete, malformed, or missing project data without
crashing. Missing artifacts MUST be represented visually rather than causing
errors. The system MUST work with projects at any stage of the IIKit workflow.

**Rationale**: Real projects are messy. Features may skip phases, artifacts
may be partially written, or directories may be empty. The tool must be
resilient to all of these conditions.

### V. Simplicity

Start simple. Prefer the minimal solution that solves the user's problem.
Do not add features, abstractions, or configurability beyond what is
specified. Follow YAGNI principles strictly.

**Rationale**: Complexity is the enemy of reliability and maintainability.
A simple tool that works reliably is more valuable than a complex tool
with more features.

## Quality Standards

- All code MUST have corresponding tests written before implementation
- All user-facing features MUST have acceptance criteria in the specification
- Error messages MUST be clear and actionable
- The system MUST be usable without reading documentation
- Accessibility MUST be considered for all visual elements

## Development Workflow

- Features MUST follow the IIKit workflow: specify, clarify, plan, checklist,
  testify, tasks, analyze, implement
- Each phase MUST be completed before proceeding to the next
- Assertion integrity MUST be maintained throughout the development process
- Code reviews MUST verify compliance with this constitution

## Governance

This constitution governs all development on the IIKit Kanban Board project.
All contributions MUST comply with these principles. Amendments require:

1. A written proposal documenting the change and rationale
2. Review of downstream impact on existing specifications and plans
3. Version bump following semantic versioning (MAJOR for principle changes,
   MINOR for additions, PATCH for clarifications)

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2026-02-10 | **Last Amended**: 2026-02-10
